It’s modern and youthful and honest. It feels like we’re sharing something with the viewer, rather than just showing them.

It’s more intimate and relatable and I think it will breathe new life into the brand, take it to a new, wider audience. After all, tenderness is something we all know. It’s not just grand gestures, and it doesn’t just happen to other people. Tenderness is there in the smallest and most everyday things. It’s offering someone the last slice of pizza.  It’s saying ‘bless you’ when they sneeze. It’s that last kiss goodnight.","targetRectangle":{"y":362.6577405929565,"x":443.7834167480469,"width":529.467992782593,"height":328.1999926567078}},{"text":"Trying to do something difficult for someone we love is an act of tenderness.
